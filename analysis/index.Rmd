| It is understood that reproduction has effects on the skeletal system, including the depletion of calcium from maternal bone stores during gestation and lactation. It is also known that the adolescent period of human development is essential to the accrual of total bone mineral density, which in turn is crucial to the prevention of osteoporosis and other detrimental bone-density loss disorders later in life. The aim of this study is to understand if there is a relationship between AFB and early osteoporosis, and if so, are individuals whose first births occurred before the age of peak BMD accrual (PBMDA, accepted to be around 20 years of age) at a higher risk for early osteoporosis than individuals whose first births occurred at/after the age of PBMDA. This study used both whole spine and femoral neck BMD as a measure of osteoporosis, demographic information, and AFB reports from publicly-available CDC NHANES data from 1999-2018. Preliminary analyses of a subsection of the larger data (2007-2008, 2009-2010) suggest that there is no statistically significant relationship between AFB before PBMDA and osteoporosis. Analyses indicate there may be an association between AFB before PBMDA and decreased BMD measurements, suggesting beginnings of premature degradation, such as osteopenia, which will be further explored in the larger analyses. This study delivers detailed analyses of NHANES longitudinal data in respect to potential associations between young motherhood and premature skeletal degradation, aiming to provide baseline information for important future studies considering the relationships between pregnancy, lactation, and skeletal health.Â  |
