## Introduction

Continued analysis for the expansion of the project into a full length paper will populate below:

Tasks for paper expansion:

-   convert BMD to T and Z scores

-   rerun original analyses with T and Z score equivalents (BMD v AFB and BMD v Parity)

    -   run new analyses with T and Z scores, \*\*\* maureen advise

-   build literature



```{r}
# T SCORE CALCULATION
# sample reference values for T-score calculation based on NHANES III

# establish mean and sd
mean_t <- 0.858
sd_t <- 0.120

# calculate T-scores
df2$t_score <- (df2$BMD - mean_t) / sd_t

```

```{r}
# Z-ZCORE CALCULATION
# reference T-scores calculated from NHANES III (as seen in Looker et al., 1998)

# import reference T-score data frame (done in Environment)
# rename df
dfref <- Femoral.Neck.BMD.Reference

# Install and load data.table package
install.packages("data.table")
library(data.table)

# # Convert to data.table
dt1 <- as.data.table(dfref)
dt2 <- as.data.table(df2)

# Parse AGE ranges into numeric lower and upper bounds
dt1[, c("age_min", "age_max") := tstrsplit(AGE, "-", type.convert = TRUE)]
dt1[, age_min := as.integer(age_min)]
dt1[, age_max := as.integer(age_max)]

# Create interval columns for dt2 (treat each age as a tiny interval)
dt2[, `:=`(age_min = AGE, age_max = AGE)]

# Set keys for interval join
setkey(dt1, age_min, age_max)
setkey(dt2, age_min, age_max)

# Perform efficient interval join
result <- foverlaps(dt2, dt1, type = "within")

# Clean and display the result
result <- result[, .(SEQN, AGE = i.AGE, REF.T.SCORE)]
print(result)

```
